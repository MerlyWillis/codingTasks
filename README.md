### 1. Task Name
**Task Manager Tool**

---

### 2. Task Overview
This task utilizes multiple modularized scripts which import into a single interface, providing the user with the ability to write tasks and descriptions to an external database file. This allows the script to save data between uses and not be overwritten. Users can then return to the script to add, remove, and update tasks over time.

This script shows the usage of while-loops, for-loops, classes, importing, and writing/reading from external files. These are fundamental skills for a career in Python development, specifically the ability to modularize projects into separate files and only import required classes/data between them to keep the code elegant and efficient.
